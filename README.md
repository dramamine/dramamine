### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you're curious about my LED art and other projects, check out my portfolio site at [metal-heart.org](https://metal-heart.org).

If you're curious about my code, here are a couple repositories worth looking at:

- [lightdream-pocket](https://github.com/dramamine/lightdream-pocket): Arduino code for LED projects
- [lightdream-artnet](https://github.com/dramamine/ffgl): Play back prerecorded Artnet light shows on a Raspberry Pi 4
- [ffgl](https://github.com/dramamine/ffgl): Some code related to blog posts I wrote on creating effects plugins for Resolume Arena.
  - Blog post: [Writing FFGL Plugins for Resolume Arena](https://metal-heart.org/writing-ffgl-plugins-for-resolume-arena-7/)
  - Youtube tutorial: [How to Write FFGL Effects Plugins for Resolume 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26uzqRbxRUk)
- [leftovers-again](https://github.com/dramamine/leftovers-again): SDK for building AI opponents for competitive Pokemon matches.
  - A professor reached out to me about using this SDK in his college class on Game AI; I ended up running a tournament for them.
  - This repo was designed with beginner developers in mind, so I focused on giving clear instructions and guiding users through each step of the process for using this SDK.
